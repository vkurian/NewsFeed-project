Hello welcome to the frontend, I am going to walk you through opening up my files based on your operating system. 
You must have install XAMPP installed on your computer , if not this is the link https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html 
If you are on a MAC after the installation go to your launchpad and open up manager-osx application 
You will see three options at the top, "WELCOME","MANAGE SERVERS", "SERVER EVENTS".click on "MANAGE SERVERS" 
there you will see "MYSQL DATABASE" , "PROFTPD" AND "APACHE WEB SERVER", you must start MYSQL DATABASE and APACHE WEB SERVER
Once you have them running go back to WELCOME tab and click on "GO TO APPLICATION" it will send you to your browser.

By this step you should already XAMP, to run the webpage "Vouyage" you will need to go to your applications folder, then look
for the XAMP folder, and then click on the htdocs folder, copy all the voyage files into that directory.

Open up your browser and type localhost/voyage.php and it will open the "Voyage News" web page.
